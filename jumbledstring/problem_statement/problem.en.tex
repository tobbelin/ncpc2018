Recall that a \emph{subsequence} of a string is any string obtained by removing some subset of characters from the string, for instance ``string'', ``sing'', ``i'' and ``sg'' are all subsequences of ``string''.  If the same subsequence can be obtained in exactly $t$ different ways, by removing different subsets of characters, we say that the subsequence occurs $t$ times.

Jingfei wants to create a nonempty bit string that has the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item the subsequence \texttt{00} occurs $a$ times,
\item the subsequence \texttt{01} occurs $b$ times,
\item the subsequence \texttt{10} occurs $c$ times, and
\item the subsequence \texttt{11} occurs $d$ times.
\end{enumerate}
However, Jingfei does not know how to create such a string -- or whether it is even possible. Could you help her?

\section*{Input}

The input consists of a single line with four integers $a$, $b$, $c$, and
$d$ ($0 \leq a,b,c,d \leq 10^9$).

\section*{Output}

Output a bit string that satisfies the given requirements. If there are several solutions, output any one of them. If there are no solutions, output ``\texttt{impossible}''.
