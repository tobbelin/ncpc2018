\problemname{Baby Bites}

\illustration{.40}{baby}{}%
\noindent
Arild just turned $1$ year old, and is currently learning how to count. His favorite thing to count is how many mouthfuls he has in a meal: every time he gets a bite, he will count it by saying the number out loud.

Unfortunately, talking while having a mouthful sometimes causes Arild to mumble incomprehensibly, making it hard to know how far he has counted. Sometimes you even suspect he loses his count! You decide to write a program to determine whether Arild's counting makes sense or not.

\section*{Input}

The first line of input contains an integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 1\,000$), the number of bites Arild receives. Then second line contains $n$ space-separated words spoken by Arild, the $i$'th of which is either a non-negative integer $a_i$ ($0 \le a_i \le 10\,000$) or the string ``\texttt{mumble}''.


\section*{Output}
If Arild's counting might make sense, print the string ``\texttt{makes sense}''. Otherwise, print the string ``\texttt{something is fishy}''.
